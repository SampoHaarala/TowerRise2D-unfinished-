# TowerRise2D-unfinished-
My first real attempt at making my own game. I stopped working on it once I figured I wanted to do it in 3D, because it would add an entire new layer of depth to the game mechanics. Feel free to to use any code as you like.
# Try it out
Download the TowerRise2DDemo folder if you want to try out the unfinished product. Controls:
- mouse 1: attack, hold for charged attack, click to proceed dialogue
- mouse 2: feint, skip attack
- alt: block
- space: dodge
- r: to interact with npc, big white squares are npcs.
- escape: menu and close menu.

  When the game starts, follow the road to the left to get to the Tower, or interact with the big white square that is a npc and follow it for dialogue.
## Game breaking bugs:
  - As the game can't be closed in menu, game must be shut down manually.
  - Saving is not implamented.
  - Propably a lot more.
